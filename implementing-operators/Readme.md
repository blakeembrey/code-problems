# Implementing Operators

Implement multiply, divide, and modulo using only the addition and subtraction operators.

Step 2: Make your functions produce answers to three decimal places (E.g. 2/3 => 0.667).

Extra credit: Make multiply accept more than two arguments.

Terror mode: Re-implement all three functions using only bitwise operators.
