# Throttle

Write a function that accepts and function and a timeout of `x` milliseconds, and returns a function that will only be executed once per `x` milliseconds. This can be useful for limiting the number of time and computation heavy function that are run. For example, making AJAX requests to an autocompletion API.

Once written, add a third parameter that will allow the function to be executed immediately if set to true. Otherwise the function will run at the end of the timeout period.
