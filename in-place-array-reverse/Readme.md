# In Place Array Reverse

An easy way to reverse an array is by building a new array of the same size but in the opposite order.

However, this requires as much extra memory as the original array takes up.

In-place reversal is a technique that requires no extra space. Write an in-place array reversal algorithm that requires O(n) time.
