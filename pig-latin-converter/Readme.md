# Pig Latin Converter

Write a function that takes an English word as a string and converts it to Pig Latin. Your Pig Latin implementation should follow two basic rules: For words that begin with consonants, move the first letter to the end of the word and add "ay" onto the end. For example:

```
"happy" → "appyhay"
```

For words that begin with vowels, add "ay" to the end of the word. For example:

```
"anchor" → "anchoray"
```

Extra credit: Make your function accept a string that contains multiple words. Don't worry about punctuation.
