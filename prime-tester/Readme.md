# Prime Tester

A prime number is a whole number that has no other divisors other than itself and 1. Write a function that accepts a number and returns true if it's a prime number, false if it's not.

Extra credit: Write a function that generates a list of all prime numbers between a user-specified range. If you're not quite sure where to start, check out the Sieve of Eratosthenes on Wikipedia. (And if you're feeling saucy, check out the Sieve of Atkin.)
