Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy; it takes in an array and using a pivot value, splits the array in half and puts all the numbers greater than the pivot in the top half, and all the numbers lower than the pivot in the bottom half. It then recurses on each half until the array is sorted.

Most JavaScript implementations have three components: the main function body, which determines when to start and stop sorting; a swap function to swap variables between the two halves of the array; and a 'partitioner' function, which does the actual sorting.

Your mission: Implement quicksort!
