Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. 
Return the sum of the three integers. 
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example: 
given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, 
and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
