# Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string, reverse all the words. To clarify, input: "Interviews are awesome!" output: "awesome! are Interviews". Consider all consecutive non-whitespace characters as individual words. If there are multiple spaces between words reduce them to a single white space. Also remove all leading and trailing whitespaces. So, the output for "   CS degree", "CS    degree", "CS degree   ", or "   CS   degree   " are all the same: "degree CS".
