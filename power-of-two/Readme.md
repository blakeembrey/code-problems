# Power of Two

Write a function that accepts a number `n` as its input and returns a boolean value representing whether or not `n` is a power of 2.

If your answer is iterative, try solving it using recursion (and vice versa). Once you've solved the problem both ways, see if you can devise a clever way of solving the problem using bitwise operators.
