# Fraction Converter

Write a function that accepts a number as its only argument and returns a fraction (as a string).

```
// These should evaluate to true
toFraction(1) === '1/1';
toFraction(0.25) === '1/4';
toFraction(0.66) === '33/50';
toFraction(0.873642) === '873642/1000000';
toFraction(1.75) === '7/4';
```
