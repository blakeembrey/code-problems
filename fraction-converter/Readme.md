# Fraction Converter

Write a function that takes a number as its argument and returns a string that represents that number's simplified fraction.

```
// These should evaluate to true
toFraction(1) === '1/1';
toFraction(0.25) === '1/4';
toFraction(0.88) === '22/25';
toFraction(0.253213) === '253213/1000000';
toFraction(1.75) === '7/4';
```
