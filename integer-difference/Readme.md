# Integer Difference

Given a non-negative integer k and an array a containing random integers, determine the number of instances where two integers in the array have a numerical difference of k.

Do not assume anything about the given inputs unless it is strictly stated.

Example 1:

```javascript
var k = 4;
var a = [1, 1, 5, 6, 9, 16, 27];

// outputs 3 (Due to 2x [1, 5], and [5, 9])
```

Example 2:

```javascript
var k = 2;
var a = [1, 1, 3, 3];

// outputs 4 (Due to 4x [1, 3])
```
