# Extend

Extend is a function that copies all the properties from one object onto a target object. Common implementations accept an infinite number of arguments, but the first argument is always the target object.

Implement a shallow extend which copies all properties from the source objects (any arguments after the first) onto the target object (first argument), overriding previous properties of the same name.

Next, implement a deep extends which will recurse into objects and arrays and clone it onto the target object.
