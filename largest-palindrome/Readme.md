# Largest Palindrome

Implement a function that finds the longest palindrome in a given string. For example, in the string "My dad is a racecar athelete", the longest palindrome is "a racecar a".  Count whitespaces as valid characters. Other palindromes in the above string include "dad", "ele", " dad " (including whitespace on each side of dad).
