A Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers that begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

For example, the first five Fibonacci numbers are:

```
0 1 1 2 3
```

If n were 4, your function should return 2; for 5, it should return 3.

Write a function that accepts a number, n, and returns the nth Fibonacci number. Use a recursive solution to this problem; if you finish with time left over, implement an iterative solution.
