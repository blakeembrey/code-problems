# Nth Fibonacci

A Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers that begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

For example, the first ten Fibonacci numbers are:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

Write a function that accepts a number and returns the `nth` fibonnaci number.
