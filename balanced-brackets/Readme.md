# Balanced Brackets

*Solutions will be evaluated based on correctness, clarity, efficiency and best practices.*

*You should use keyboard input and console output in all cases but parameter passing to functions are also acceptable. The input and output cases shown are for testing purposes only, and are not an accurate representation of the test data.*

Given a string consisting entirely of the characters ()[]{}, determine if it is "balanced". That is, every opening bracket must have a closing bracket of the same type following it, and the string in between the pair must also be balanced. For the purposes of the problem, an empty string should be considered balanced.

**Input 1**

```
()[]{}(([])){[()][]}
```

**Output 1**

```
balanced
```

**Input 2**

```
())[]{}
```

**Output 2**

```
not balanced
```

**Input 3**

```
[(])
```

**Output 3**

```
not balanced
```

## Solution

```
node index.js
# Every new line will output a new result
()[]{}(([])){[()][]}
())[]{}
[(])
```
