# Code Problems

This is my repo full of code problems that I have completed prior to or during an interview. I hope that all these problems (and solutions) are useful to practice against and review. Feel free to contribute any solutions and optimisations, given they are algorithmic optimisations. Please add your own problems that you find as well, as I would love to see them.

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

Lint and test your code using any means applicable, in JavaScript this means JSHint and Mocha which is run using Nodejs.

## Testing

```sh
npm install # Installs `mocha` and any other dependencies needed to run
npm test    # Runs the testing scripts
```
