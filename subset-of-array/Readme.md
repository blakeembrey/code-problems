# Is Subset of Array?

Make an array method that can return whether or not a context array is a subset of an input array.  To simplify the problem, you can assume that both arrays will contain only strings.

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) for more on the definition of a subset.

Extra credit: Make the method work for arrays that contain any value, including non-strings.
