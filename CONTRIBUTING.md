In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

Indentation should be set to two spaces. If you are adding a new problem, consider adding an entry on the problems list in the readme where applicable.

Please lint and test your code with any means available - currently JavaScript has tests and linting via Mocha and JSHint.
